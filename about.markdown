# Welcome to the ISC2 Scotland Chapter website!

Thank you for your interest in our Scotland Chapter.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to bring together a community of Scotland's Information Security Professionals, promote cybersecurity awareness, and share knowledge on evolving security threats to drive innovation in the field. We aim to provide a platform that facilitates networking, collaboration, and professional growth within our membership.

## History

The Scotland Chapter was founded in 2014 by Ewan McIntyre, [James Kwaan](https://linkedin.com/in/james-k-5201384){:target="\_blank"}, Neil Campbell and [Manish Shah](https://linkedin.com/in/manishcisspf){:target="\_blank"} among others and was running successfully till 2019. In 2020, due to the pandemic, the chapter became defunct. But in June 2023, a couple of security professionals came together and started conversations with ISC2 to revive the chapter.

We look forward to welcoming new members and continuing to grow as a valuable resource for Information Security Professionals in Scotland.

<br />

**President, ISC2 Scotland Chapter.**
